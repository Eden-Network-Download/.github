## What is Eden Network?

Eden Network is a specialized Ethereum transaction routing service designed to protect users from miner extractable value (MEV) while providing priority access to block space. The network operates as an alternative transaction routing layer that gives traders and DeFi participants more control over how their transactions are processed.

At its core, Eden Network provides two main value propositions: protection against harmful MEV and prioritized transaction processing. The service works by routing transactions through a private mempool where they're shielded from front-running bots and other predatory MEV strategies. This protection is particularly valuable for large trades, arbitrage opportunities, and other transaction types that are typically targeted by MEV bots.

The priority access component ensures that transactions are included in blocks quickly and reliably, even during periods of network congestion. Eden Network achieves this through strategic partnerships with block builders and validators, creating a more predictable transaction environment for users who need execution certainty.

Beyond these core features, Eden Network offers detailed analytics about transaction performance and MEV risks. Users can see exactly how their transactions would have fared on the public mempool compared to Eden's protected environment. The service also provides tools for estimating optimal gas prices and transaction timing based on current network conditions.

Integration is straightforward through custom RPC endpoints that can be added to any Ethereum wallet or trading bot. The network supports all standard Ethereum transactions and is compatible with popular DeFi applications. For advanced users, Eden offers API access to programmatically manage transaction routing strategies.
